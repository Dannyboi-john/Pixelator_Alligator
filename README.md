# [Pixelator Alligator Demo](https://dannyboi-john.github.io/Pixelator_Alligator/) 🐊

# Motivation 🏃

This project, like most, was born out of necessity. Initially conceived to help me out with my crochet designs, it has found several other uses including Perler Beads and embroidery!

# What does it do? 🤷‍♂️

In a nutshell, this software takes a user-submitted image and pixelates it according to your specified dimensions!

# How do I work this thing? 🤔

<p>
  <h3>Step 1:</h3> Select an image to pixelate, either by browsing your files of dragging and dropping from a folder. If being viewed on a mobile device, you also have the option of taking a picture and using that instead!
</p>

<p>
  <h3>Step 2:</h3> Select the dimensions you want your image to be. This is measured in pixels (eg// 10 for the width and 12 for the height)
</p>

<p>
  <h3>Step 3:</h3> If you want your image to be overlain onto a grid, you can do that as well! Just select the dimesions of the grid (at least as big as the image) and away you go!
